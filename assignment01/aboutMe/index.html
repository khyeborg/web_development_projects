				<p>Hi Mr. Grader,</p>
				
				<p>My name is Eevee. I am a normal type Gen 1 Pokemon (the best gen there is, before Pokemons got weird). 
				Trainers always want to evolve me into a stronger Pokemon - a Pokemon that looks more badass or a Pokemon that at least has a type (I guess, normal type doesn't really count as a type. I just feel so... normal), but I really fancy the way I am and I refuse to comply to the flawed standards once created by the Pokemon Lord (Arceus).
				Some nights, I lay in my little Eevee bed with my tiny Eevee thoughts. I wonder if anyone is going to love me for who I am, like how I love myself. I love my skin color and I do not wish to change it.
				Occasionally, I also wonder if I am a cat or a dog in the parallel universe we call "reality". I "meow" every now and then, so I guess I would be a cat. Yeah, actually, that's right, I am a cat. I guess that thought would no longer bother me in the lonely dark nights. I wonder if Umbreon has these dark thoughts too.</p>
			
				<p>Anyway, back to my usual thoughts. Can I tell you a secret? You're not there to answer me, so my guess is, you're saying "Sure, go ahead little Eevee! I would love for nothing more than to be best friends with you!"
				Thank you for wanting to be best friends with me, but you should know that I already have a best friend. My best friend's name is "Myself". Yes, that is right, I love Myself. Myself is a Rattata I met on the streets one day. Long story short, he bit me and almost gave me Leptospirosis. He said I tasted yummy and I was very flattered so we exchanged numbers and started texting ever since.</p>

				<p>Ughh I keep going off on a tangent. Oh right! You wanted to know about my secret! Here. Do you know how terrified I get when I see a water stone, thunder stone, or fire stone lying nearby?! I am scared to the power of infinity times two!
				The idea of completely changing who I am (including my name) just because I accidentally touched a stone horrifies me. To avoid that, I refuse to walk in gardens and parks because of all the stones lying around!
				I am happy and cheerful all the time and that terrifies me too! I can't help it, I am a very optimistic Eevee (that's the nature I was assigned at birth and it's not changeable). But if you know Eevees well enough, you know that an Eevee evolves into an Espeon or an Umbreon when they get too happy! How terrifying that is.
				Even worse, I have to be extra careful about not getting too excited at night cause Lord (Arceus) knows how horrible it would be if I turned into an gothic feline creature (Umbreon).
				</p>

				<p>The truth is, I am struggling. I am struggling every day with my own identity. I want to be an Eevee, but it always seems like it's me against the world. Help me Lord Arceus, I need you! *sobs</p>

				<p>Sincerely,<br>Sad Eevee</p>
